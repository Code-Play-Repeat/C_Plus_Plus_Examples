UCM CSE 165 Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming
=======================================================

+ Contained within this folder are all the C++ code created during the labs of the CSE 165 Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming class.
+ The programs can be run through the terminal by compiling the programs through GNU C++ compiler for linux and running the created object files.
+ In order to make sense of what some of these programs due each one is an exercise from the book Thinking in C++: Introduction to Standard C++, 2nd Edition.
+ More specifically each program's name contains the Chapter number and the exercise number i.e. 15-1 represents chapter 15 exercise 1.
+ The exercise section itself is contained at the end of each corresponding chapter.
+ I will include links for free download of the book.
+ This link is the main site of the book and contains many mirror sites for downloading the book and its source code for the exercises.

+ I will also include one of the working links that contains a zip file with a html portion and source code portion for the book.
