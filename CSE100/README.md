==========================================

+ Contained within this folder are all the C++ code created for CSE 111 Algorithms Design and Analysis class.
+ The pdfs contain explanations of the labs.
+ The programs can be run through the terminal by compiling the programs through GNU C++ compiler for linux and running the created object files.
+ Some labs contain makefiles where all you have to do is run make in the terminal while located in that folder.
+ Running make will compile the necessary (.o) object files to run.
+ Most labs need each program to be compiled separately and run the corresponding (.o) object files.
